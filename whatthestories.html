<h1>What is Going On?</h1>
<p><i>         Are you kidding me? I could have been home sleep. And why are using my bathroom??How did you even get into my house you 
  creepy son of Mark? Just because he's my friend and I poop in his toilet doesn't mean you can do that in my house. Get out of my candy
  house. Tommy pulls up his pants and flushes the toilet. Then walks out of into the kitchen for some food. Bob says " What the hell
  do you think your doing? You don't live in this house. Get the flip out of here." "So you dont have any pizza." Tommy says as he
  scratches his cratch. He closes the fridge and grabs a bag of chips from bob's counter while Bob's still yelling at him. " Whatever man.
  Do you want some?" Tommy gestures to the bag of chips. Bob angrily pulls his phone from his back pocket and starts dialing numbers.
  Tommy doesn't know who Bob is calling. </i></p>
