<h1>What's going on?</h1>
<p><i>         Are you kidding me? I could have been home sleep. And why are using my bathroom??How did you even get into my house you 
  creepy son of Mark? Just because he's my friend and I poop in his toilet doesn't mean you can do that in my house. Get out of my candy
  house. Tommy pulls up his pants and flushes the toilet. Then walks out of into the kitchen for some food. Bob says " What the hell
  do you think your doing? You don't live in this house. Get the flip out of here." "So you dont have any pizza." Tommy says as he

  to his room with his hands to his face. "It will all be over soon." Bob thinks in  his mind not knowing that Tommy is a snoopy person.
  While Bob is finding Tommy some clothes, Tommy started being nosey. He started to look in Bob's kitchen drowers and didn't see anything 
  until he opened the drower next to the frige and saw an envelope. When he looked in side, he saw 20 thousand dollars. Then Bob walks
  in... </p>
